# FaunaDB

In this example we will be deploying a simple "Hello World" example with FaunaDB.

To run, deploy using a FaunaDB client secret like this:

```bash
now -e FAUNADB_SECRET=fnADHJNX-IACAsrqnthNLSGJgT5_SL5gHabuvGpw
```

This is a read only key to a toy database, but provisioning your own key is easy via https://dashboard.fauna.com/
